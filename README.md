# Overview
The simple world program for this project simulates a number of creatures running around in a simple world. The world is an m-by-n two-dimensional grid of squares. Each creature lives in one of the squares, faces in one of the major compass directions (north, east, south, or west), and belongs to a particular species, which determines how that creature behaves. Each square also has a specific terrain type. Each creature may also have some special abilities, including flying and archery.
